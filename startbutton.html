        <h3>Beach Clean Up Game</h3>
        <p>People keep throwing trash on the beach. In order to make the beach clean again, you can help us! 
            Pick up the trash by clicking on it. Don't wait to long to pick it up, otherwise it will end up in the ocean. 
            <br>
            But be careful with the racoons. If you give them the opportunity, they will go through the trash and spread the trash again...
