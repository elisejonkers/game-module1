# Beach clean up game 

## MVP
Every x seconds an box (green) will appear and it will disappear after y seconds. If you don't click on the box within y seconds, you'll lose. 

## More advanced
- A second type of box (red) will be added with a different functionality. If you click on these boxes, you'll lose.
- Speed of the appearance of the boxes will increase
- Adding a score for every green box

### Milestone 1

- [x] Add functionality to click
- [x] Add functionality that box disappears after clicking

### Milestone 2

### Milestone 4

### Milestone 5 
- [x] Add the second type of box with the right properties
- [x] Add the functionality of not clicking the red box
- [ ] Add functionality so boxes will be random (green vs. red)

### Milestone 6
- [ ] Keep track of score. Every clicked green box is +1

### Milestone 7
- [ ] Increasing the speed 

### Milestone 8: UI

- [ ] Scoreboard becomes a trash can
- [ ] Update game over page

### Debugging
- [ ] Boxes can't overlap
- [ ] Having two boxes in the screen at the same time (speeding up). Right now it will be game over immediately, because the allNotClick array can't be longer than 0
